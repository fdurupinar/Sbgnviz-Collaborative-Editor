Compatible Newt commit
https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/newt/commit/e7e42c4b0368b65e4f83dcafabb2c513a95a6284

How to Upgrade
In public/app folder the required changes are marked by "cwc-change" comments. Search "cwc-change"
in that folder and apply the same changes at the top of the app folder of original Newt.

However, unfortunately in views/index.html and public/app/css/chise.css such changes are not noted
(it is already not very feasible for index.html). For these files check the difference between
the currently used Newt version and the new version to be upgraded to. Apply the same changes to
the related file in collaborative editor.

After making the upgrade do not forget to update the compatible Newt commit/version in this file.
